        /**
         *   One of the two render modes in p5.js, used for
         *   computationally intensive tasks like 3D rendering
         *   and shaders. WEBGL differs from the default P2D
         *   renderer in the following ways:
         *
         *   - Coordinate System - When drawing in WEBGL mode,
         *   the origin point (0,0,0) is located at the center
         *   of the screen, not the top-left corner. See the
         *   learn page about coordinates and transformations.
         *   - 3D Shapes - WEBGL mode can be used to draw
         *   3-dimensional shapes like box(), sphere(), cone(),
         *   and more. See the learn page about custom geometry
         *   to make more complex objects.
         *   - Shape Detail - When drawing in WEBGL mode, you
         *   can specify how smooth curves should be drawn by
         *   using a detail parameter. See the wiki section
         *   about shapes for a more information and an
         *   example.
         *   - Textures - A texture is like a skin that wraps
         *   onto a shape. See the wiki section about textures
         *   for examples of mapping images onto surfaces with
         *   textures.
         *   - Materials and Lighting - WEBGL offers different
         *   types of lights like ambientLight() to place
         *   around a scene. Materials like specularMaterial()
         *   reflect the lighting to convey shape and depth.
         *   See the learn page for styling and appearance to
         *   experiment with different combinations.
         *   - Camera - The viewport of a WEBGL sketch can be
         *   adjusted by changing camera attributes. See the
         *   learn page section about cameras for an
         *   explanation of camera controls.
         *   - Text - WEBGL requires opentype/truetype font
         *   files to be preloaded using loadFont(). See the
         *   wiki section about text for details, along with a
         *   workaround.
         *   - Shaders - Shaders are hardware accelerated
         *   programs that can be used for a variety of effects
         *   and graphics. See the introduction to shaders to
         *   get started with shaders in p5.js.
         *   - Graphics Acceleration - WEBGL mode uses the
         *   graphics card instead of the CPU, so it may help
         *   boost the performance of your sketch (example:
         *   drawing more shapes on the screen at once).
         *
         *   To learn more about WEBGL mode, check out all the
         *   interactive WEBGL tutorials in the "Learn" section
         *   of this website, or read the wiki article "Getting
         *   started with WebGL in p5".

         *   is UNSIGNED_BYTE.
         *   - channels: What color channels to store, either

         *   with setAttributes.)
         *   - depth: A boolean, whether or not to include a

         *   render with antialiased edges, and if so,
         *   optionally the number of samples to use. Defaults
         *   to whether or not the main canvas is antialiased,
         *   using a default of 2 samples if so. Antialiasing
         *   is only supported when WebGL 2 is available.
         *   - width: The width of the texture. Defaults to
         *   matching the main canvas.
         *   - height: The height of the texture. Defaults to
         *   matching the main canvas.

         *   - textureFiltering: Either LINEAR (nearby pixels
         *   will be interpolated when reading values from the
         *   color texture) or NEAREST (no interpolation.)
         *   Generally, use LINEAR when using the texture as an

         *   The p5() constructor enables you to activate

         *   Shiffman's Coding Train video tutorial or this
         *   tutorial page for more info. By default, all p5.js

         *   simply ellipse(), fill(), etc. However, this might
         *   be inconvenient if you are mixing with other JS
         *   libraries (synchronously or asynchronously) or
         *   writing long programs of your own. p5.js currently
         *   supports a way around this problem called
         *   "instance mode". In instance mode, all p5
         *   functions are bound up in a single variable
         *   instead of polluting your global namespace.

         *   While the above method is complex, it is flexible
         *   enough to work with any pixelDensity. Note that
         *   set() will automatically take care of setting all

         *   y) at any pixelDensity, but the performance may
         *   not be as fast when lots of modifications are made

        /**
         *   Returns the Perlin noise value at specified
         *   coordinates. Perlin noise is a random sequence
         *   generator producing a more naturally ordered,
         *   harmonic succession of numbers compared to the
         *   standard random() function. It was invented by Ken
         *   Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in
         *   graphical applications to produce procedural
         *   textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc.
         *   The main difference to the random() function is
         *   that Perlin noise is defined in an infinite
         *   n-dimensional space where each pair of coordinates
         *   corresponds to a fixed semi-random value (fixed
         *   only for the lifespan of the program; see the
         *   noiseSeed() function). p5.js can compute 1D, 2D
         *   and 3D noise, depending on the number of
         *   coordinates given. The resulting value will always
         *   be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be
         *   animated by moving through the noise space as
         *   demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd and 3rd
         *   dimensions can also be interpreted as time.
         *
         *   The actual noise is structured similar to an audio
         *   signal, in respect to the function's use of
         *   frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics
         *   in physics, Perlin noise is computed over several
         *   octaves which are added together for the final
         *   result.
         *
         *   Another way to adjust the character of the
         *   resulting sequence is the scale of the input
         *   coordinates. As the function works within an
         *   infinite space the value of the coordinates
         *   doesn't matter as such, only the distance between
         *   successive coordinates does (eg. when using
         *   noise() within a loop). As a general rule the
         *   smaller the difference between coordinates, the
         *   smoother the resulting noise sequence will be.
         *   Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most
         *   applications, but this will differ depending on
         *   use.

         *   Adjusts the character and level of detail produced
         *   by the Perlin noise function. Similar to harmonics
         *   in physics, noise is computed over several
         *   octaves. Lower octaves contribute more to the
         *   output signal and as such define the overall
         *   intensity of the noise, whereas higher octaves
         *   create finer-grained details in the noise
         *   sequence. By default, noise is computed over 4

         *   as much as its predecessor, starting at 50%
         *   strength for the 1st octave. This falloff amount
         *   can be changed by adding an additional function

         *   A class to describe a two or three-dimensional

         *   geometric) vector. A vector is an entity that has
         *   both magnitude and direction. The datatype,
         *   however, stores the components of the vector (x, y
         *   for 2D; or x, y, z for 3D). The magnitude and
         *   direction can be accessed via the methods
         *   p5.Vector.mag() and heading(). In many of the
         *   p5.js examples, you will see p5.Vector used to
         *   describe a position, velocity, or acceleration.
         *   For example, if you consider a rectangle moving
         *   across the screen, at any given instant it has a
         *   position (a vector that points from the origin to
